# Homeless Shelter Location Analysis
**University of California, San Diego ‚Äì DSC170 Final Project**

This project analyzes spatial, demographic, and socioeconomic data to identify optimal locations for homeless shelters in San Diego.  
We combined geospatial analytics, data visualization, and correlation analysis to support data-driven urban planning.
